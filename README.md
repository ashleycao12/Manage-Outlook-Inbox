# Manage-Outlook-Inbox
* This is useful for people that have a large number of Outlook emails that need to be moved to different folders. 
* Instead of creating and managing 20 different Outlook rules, this package and run everything in one go. 
* You just need to create and update a csv file to instruct which email should go where (see Instruction.csv for an example)
* It maintains a record of everything it moves (see Filerelocation.csv).
